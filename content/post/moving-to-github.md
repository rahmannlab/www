From now on the website of our reasearch group is online at https://rahmannlab.github.io .
The content is rendered using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) on [Travis-CI](https://travis-ci.org) or locally.

Source code of newly developed programs will be part of our Github group 
[`github.com/rahmannlab`](https://github.com/rahmannlab).
Old projects are mainly located at
[`bitbucket.org/genomeinformatics`](https://bitbucket.org/genomeinformatics/)
and will be maintained there.
